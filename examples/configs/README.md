# Unified training recipe catalog

Every draft model JSON under `configs/` has at least one typed YAML recipe in
this catalog. Choose a recipe by answering three separate questions:

1. **When are target features produced?** `online` captures them during the
   run; `offline` reads feature files prepared earlier.
2. **How are feature supply and training deployed?** `colocated` maps to
   `deployment.mode: local_colocated` and lets the trainer read offline files
   directly; `disaggregated` uses separate producer and consumer roles.
3. **Who owns the online infrastructure?** `external` means the user or
   scheduler owns Mooncake and SGLang; `managed-local` means SpecForge starts
   and stops those services on the local host.

Those decisions map directly to the directory tree:

```text
examples/configs/
├── offline/
│   ├── colocated/
│   └── disaggregated/
└── online/
    ├── colocated/
    └── disaggregated/
        ├── external/
        └── managed-local/
```

| Directory | Feature source | SpecForge roles | Infrastructure ownership |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `offline/colocated` | Precomputed `.ckpt` files | Trainer only | Not applicable |
| `offline/disaggregated` | Precomputed files ingested into `shared_dir` or Mooncake | Producer + consumer | Storage is configured separately; there is no `external`/`managed-local` subdivision |
| `online/colocated` | — | — | Reserved; the current runtime does not support online colocated training |
| `online/disaggregated/external` | Live SGLang capture | Producer + consumer | User or scheduler starts Mooncake and SGLang |
| `online/disaggregated/managed-local` | Live SGLang capture | Producer + consumer | SpecForge starts local Mooncake and SGLang from `managed_local` |

The directory is the source of truth for mode, topology, and service ownership.
Some filenames retain historical `-online`, `-offline`, or `-disaggregated`
labels so existing recipe identities and run names remain recognizable.

Run any recipe through the one public training entry:

```bash
specforge train --config examples/configs/online/disaggregated/external/qwen3-8b-eagle3-disaggregated.yaml
```

`model.draft_model_config` may name a local JSON file, a local model directory,
or a Hugging Face repository. Fresh EAGLE3, P-EAGLE, and DFlash runs may omit it
and derive the draft architecture from the target; see the
[training guide](../../docs/sections/basic_usage/training.md#draft-configuration-and-model-initialization)
for layer/block overrides and the distinction between weights-only
`model.draft_checkpoint_path` and full `training.resume_from`.

Every recipe records its audited process count under `deployment.trainer`.
Multi-process configs self-launch through torch distributed:

```bash
specforge train -c examples/configs/online/disaggregated/external/qwen3-30b-a3b-eagle3-online.yaml
```

The Qwen3-30B-A3B EAGLE3.1 variant uses the same unified entry point:

```bash
specforge train -c examples/configs/online/disaggregated/external/qwen3-30b-a3b-eagle3.1-online.yaml
```

Its draft config enables per-layer RMS normalization before the three captured
target hidden states are concatenated and projected. It remains registered as
the `eagle3` strategy; EAGLE3.1 is a draft-model configuration variant, not a
second runtime or launch path.

Recipes under `online/disaggregated/managed-local` are opt-in, single-node
full-stack examples. Their typed `managed_local` blocks own Mooncake, one or
more patched SGLang capture servers, and the trainer GPU allocation; the same
`specforge train -c ...` command starts and cleans up the complete stack.
Recipes under `online/disaggregated/external` omit `managed_local`, so Mooncake
and SGLang remain owned by the user, scheduler, or service platform.

The `kimi-k3-dspark-disaggregated.yaml` recipe is the external
two-node migration of the 64K Kimi K3 continual run. Its dedicated
[runbook](../../docs/recipes/kimi-k3-dspark-disaggregated.md) pins the K3
SGLang revision and patch target, preserves the old effective global batch and
prompt order, and documents the TP8 capture plus four-rank trainer topology.

`deepseek-v4-flash-dspark-disaggregated.yaml` trains a DSpark drafter for
DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 from scratch on ShareGPT, with external capture
servers. Its
[runbook](../../docs/recipes/deepseek-v4-flash-dspark-disaggregated.md)
covers the v0.5.18 SGLang capture patch and the bundled `deepseek-v4` chat
template (the checkpoint ships no Jinja template).

`qwen3.8-27b-dflash2-disaggregated.yaml` (external services, two nodes) and
its managed-local siblings `qwen3.8-27b-dflash2-4server-dp4-disaggregated.yaml`
(one node, four capture servers plus a DP4 trainer) and
`qwen3.8-27b-dflash2-h200-5server-dp3-disaggregated.yaml` (one 8x H200 node,
five FP8 capture servers with FA3 and FlashInfer GDN, a DP3 trainer, RDMA
loopback) train the DFlash2 drafter in `configs/qwen3.8-27b-dflash2.json` for
Qwen3.8-27B. Their
[runbook](../../docs/recipes/qwen3.8-27b-dflash2-disaggregated.md) records the
server/trainer splits, Mooncake lease, in-flight watermarks and throughput
measured on B300 and H200 nodes, and the two-node launcher that starts eight
capture servers.

Before running a recipe, update model/data paths and create any referenced
offline feature or vocabulary-mapping artifacts. Managed-local recipes
intentionally record their GPU allocation and loopback services. External
deployments may record stable endpoints in YAML or override them through the
environment; credentials, tokens, and node-local identity should not be checked
into a portable recipe.

## Writing a recipe

The Pydantic models in `specforge/config/schema.py` are the authoritative
schema. This section explains what belongs in each YAML section and records the
defaults that matter when writing a recipe. Unknown or misspelled fields are
errors; YAML files and dotted CLI overrides go through the same validation.

New checked-in recipes should explicitly set `training.strategy`,
`deployment.mode`, `deployment.trainer.nnodes`,
`deployment.trainer.nproc_per_node`, `run_id`, and `output_dir`, even when the
schema has the same default. A minimal online recipe with externally managed
services looks like:

```yaml
model:
  target_model_path: Qwen/Qwen3-8B
  draft_model_config: configs/qwen3-8b-eagle3.json
  target_backend: sglang
  vocab_mapping_path: cache/vocab_mapping/qwen3-8b.pt

data:
  train_data_path: ./cache/dataset/sharegpt_train.jsonl
  max_length: 4096
  chat_template: qwen

training:
  strategy: eagle3
  max_steps: 10000
  batch_size: 1
  learning_rate: 0.0001

run_id: qwen3-8b-eagle3-disaggregated
output_dir: outputs/qwen3-8b-eagle3-disaggregated

deployment:
  mode: disaggregated
  trainer:
    nnodes: 1
    nproc_per_node: 1
  disaggregated:
    control_dir: outputs/qwen3-8b-eagle3-disaggregated/control
    consumer_state_dir: outputs/qwen3-8b-eagle3-disaggregated/consumer-state
    backend: mooncake
    server_urls:
      - http://127.0.0.1:30000
    mooncake_metadata_server: http://127.0.0.1:35880/metadata
    mooncake_master_server_addr: 127.0.0.1:35551
```

Paths are resolved from the current working directory. The checked-in recipes
assume the command runs from the repository root.

### Choose a starting recipe

| Workflow | Canonical starting point |
| --- | --- |
| EAGLE3 offline, colocated | [`offline/colocated/qwen3-8b-eagle3-offline.yaml`](offline/colocated/qwen3-8b-eagle3-offline.yaml) |
| DFlash offline, colocated | [`offline/colocated/qwen3-8b-dflash-offline.yaml`](offline/colocated/qwen3-8b-dflash-offline.yaml) |

| EAGLE3 online, external services | [`online/disaggregated/external/qwen3-8b-eagle3-disaggregated.yaml`](online/disaggregated/external/qwen3-8b-eagle3-disaggregated.yaml) |
| DFlash online, managed-local stack | [`online/disaggregated/managed-local/qwen3-8b-dflash-1server-dp7-disaggregated.yaml`](online/disaggregated/managed-local/qwen3-8b-dflash-1server-dp7-disaggregated.yaml) |
| DFlash 2 online, managed-local stack | [`online/disaggregated/managed-local/qwen3.8-27b-dflash2-4server-dp4-disaggregated.yaml`](online/disaggregated/managed-local/qwen3.8-27b-dflash2-4server-dp4-disaggregated.yaml) |
| DFlash 2 online, external services on two nodes | [`online/disaggregated/external/qwen3.8-27b-dflash2-disaggregated.yaml`](online/disaggregated/external/qwen3.8-27b-dflash2-disaggregated.yaml) |
| Domino online, managed-local stack | [`online/disaggregated/managed-local/qwen3-8b-domino-multiserver-disaggregated.yaml`](online/disaggregated/managed-local/qwen3-8b-domino-multiserver-disaggregated.yaml) |

The runtime derives online/offline mode from the selected `data` source and
reads topology from `deployment.mode`; it does not parse the filename or its
historical suffixes.

### Top-level fields

| Field | Default | What to write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run_id` | `specforge-run` | Stable identifier for the run. It names checkpoints and is also the default disaggregated store namespace. Use a new value for a fresh attempt. |
| `output_dir` | `./output` | Shared checkpoint, profiler, and tracker output directory. Every trainer rank must resolve it to the same location. |

The top-level `model` and `data` sections are required. `training`, `tracking`,
`profiling`, `runtime`, and `deployment` have defaults, but checked-in recipes
should make their training strategy and topology explicit.

### `model`: target, draft, and capture backend

| Field | Default | What to write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model.target_model_path` | required | Local target directory or Hugging Face repository ID. |
| `model.draft_model_config` | `null` | Draft JSON, model directory containing `config.json`, or Hugging Face repository. EAGLE3, P-EAGLE, and DFlash may omit it and derive a fresh config; Domino and DSpark require one. |
| `model.draft_checkpoint_path` | `null` | Weights-only warm start for a new run. Do not combine it with `training.resume_from`. |
| `model.draft_num_hidden_layers` | `null` | Positive fresh-architecture override where the strategy permits it. EAGLE3 remains one layer; P-EAGLE and DFlash may override their generated defaults. |
| `model.draft_block_size` | `null` | Positive DFlash block-size override; generated DFlash configs default to 16. |
| `model.target_backend` | `sglang` | `sglang` is the only accepted value; retired `hf`/`custom` names fail at config load. Offline feature consumers do not instantiate a target inference backend. |
| `model.input_modality` | `text` | The provider modality. The unified runtime supports text only; VLM modalities such as `qwen2_5_vl` are rejected. |
| `model.shard_target_output` | `false` | Retained for config migration; leave it false on the online disaggregated path. |
| `model.trust_remote_code` | `false` | Enable only for model repositories that require custom loading code. |
| `model.use_liger_kernel` | `false` | Enable Liger Qwen3 RMSNorm/SwiGLU kernels for DFlash training. Requires the `specforge[liger]` extra. |
| `model.embedding_key` | `model.embed_tokens.weight` | Target checkpoint key copied into or used by the draft embedding. |
| `model.lm_head_key` | `lm_head.weight` | Target checkpoint key used for the frozen output head. |
| `model.vocab_mapping_path` | `""` | Target-to-draft vocabulary mapping. EAGLE3 disaggregated runs require an explicit shared file. |
| `model.load_target_embedding` | `true` | Copy the frozen target embedding into a fresh draft when supported. |
| `model.aux_hidden_state_layer_ids` | `null` | Optional EAGLE3/P-EAGLE capture override containing exactly three non-negative layer IDs. Other strategies derive layers from the draft config. |
| `model.torch_dtype` | `bfloat16` | `bfloat16`, `float16`, or `float32`. |
| `model.cache_dir` | `null` | Model/tokenizer download cache. This is distinct from `data.cache_dir`. |
| `model.mask_token_id` | `null` | DFlash-family/P-EAGLE mask token override. Otherwise it resolves from the draft config and then the tokenizer. |
| `model.tokenizer_pad_token_id` | `null` | Explicit non-negative tokenizer pad ID. Use it for released tokenizers that omit padding metadata. |
| `model.sglang_attention_backend` | `flashinfer` | SGLang attention implementation for an in-process or managed capture server. |
| `model.sglang_mem_fraction_static` | `0.4` | SGLang static-memory fraction in `(0, 1]`; inherited by managed capture servers unless they override it. |
| `model.sglang_disable_radix_cache` | `true` | Preserve the historical managed-capture behavior. Set `false` for hybrid targets such as Inkling that require the radix tree. Unique per-attempt cache namespaces still force complete capture prefills. |
| `model.sglang_context_length` | `null` | Positive explicit context limit. Managed capture requires at least `data.max_length + 7`; omitting it derives that value. |
| `model.sglang_enable_nccl_nvls` | `false` | Pass the matching SGLang NCCL NVLS optimization flag. |
| `model.sglang_enable_symm_mem` | `false` | Pass the matching SGLang symmetric-memory flag. |
| `model.sglang_enable_torch_compile` | `false` | Enable the SGLang torch-compile path. |
| `model.sglang_enable_dp_attention` | `false` | Enable SGLang DP attention where supported. Managed-local capture currently rejects it. |
| `model.sglang_enable_dp_lm_head` | `false` | Enable SGLang DP LM head where supported. Managed-local capture currently rejects it. |
| `model.sglang_ep_size` | `1` | SGLang expert-parallel size; it must divide and not exceed every managed capture server's `tp_size`. |
| `model.sglang_max_running_requests` | `null` | Positive SGLang request-concurrency limit. |
| `model.sglang_max_total_tokens` | `null` | Positive SGLang token-pool limit. |
| `model.sglang_dp_size` | `null` | Optional SGLang data-parallel size. |
| `model.sglang_moe_a2a_backend` | `null` | Optional SGLang MoE all-to-all backend name. |
| `model.sglang_moe_runner_backend` | `null` | Optional SGLang MoE runner backend name. |
| `model.sglang_page_size` | `null` | Optional positive SGLang KV-cache page size. |
| `model.sglang_quantization` | `null` | Optional SGLang target quantization mode. |
| `model.sglang_fp4_gemm_runner_backend` | `null` | Optional SGLang FP4 GEMM runner backend, passed as `--fp4-gemm-backend`. |
| `model.sglang_mamba_radix_cache_strategy` | `null` | Optional hybrid Mamba/radix cache strategy. |
| `model.sglang_max_mamba_cache_size` | `null` | Optional positive Mamba cache size. |
| `model.sglang_swa_full_tokens_ratio` | `null` | Optional SGLang sliding-window full-token ratio in `(0, 1]`. |
| `model.sglang_mamba_full_memory_ratio` | `null` | Optional SGLang Mamba full-memory ratio in `(0, 1]`. |
| `model.sglang_max_prefill_tokens` | `null` | Optional positive token budget of one SGLang prefill batch (`--max-prefill-tokens`). |
| `model.sglang_linear_attn_prefill_backend` | `null` | Optional linear-attention (GDN/KDA) prefill kernel backend for hybrid targets (`--linear-attn-prefill-backend`). |
| `model.sglang_fp8_gemm_backend` | `null` | Optional blockwise FP8 GEMM runner (`--fp8-gemm-backend`). |
| `model.sglang_disable_cuda_graph` | `false` | Pass `--disable-cuda-graph`, which disables SGLang's decode and prefill CUDA graphs. |
| `model.sglang_extra_args` | `[]` | Further SGLang CLI tokens appended to every managed-local capture server, one flag or value per list item (`["--prefill-max-requests", "8"]`). The list must start with a `--flag`. Flags the launcher owns (`--model-path`, `--port`, `--host`, `--tp-size`, `--dtype`, `--trust-remote-code`, `--skip-tokenizer-init`, `--chunked-prefill-size`, `--context-length`, the `--spec-capture-*` flags) and flags another `model.sglang_*` field already renders are rejected, including their SGLang aliases and abbreviations; so are `--api-key` (the capture adapter sends no key), `--enable-dp-attention`/`--enable-dp-lm-head` (unsupported by managed-local capture) and `--config`. External servers take their flags from their own launch command. |

### `data`: choose exactly one training source

Exactly one of the first three fields must be non-empty:

| Field | Default | What to write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data.train_data_path` | `""` | Raw conversation/preformatted JSON or JSONL sent to the online capture producer. |
| `data.prompts_path` | `""` | Pre-tokenized online JSONL with `input_ids` and `loss_mask`. |
| `data.hidden_states_path` | `""` | Directory of precomputed offline feature `.ckpt` files. Selecting it makes the run offline. |
| `data.eval_data_path` | `""` | Reserved migration field. Online evaluation is unsupported; leave it empty. |
| `data.eval_hidden_states_path` | `""` | Offline evaluation features; configure them together with a positive `training.eval_interval`. |
| `data.max_length` | `2048` | Maximum token length used by preparation, capture, and training. |
| `data.chat_template` | `llama3` | Template name used to format conversations and locate assistant loss spans. |
| `data.is_preformatted` | `false` | Treat each record's text as already formatted by `chat_template`. |
| `data.train_only_last_turn` | `false` | Restrict the loss mask to the final assistant turn. |
| `data.build_dataset_num_proc` | `8` | Positive CPU process count for dataset preprocessing. |
| `data.dataloader_num_workers` | `null` | Ordered feature-loader workers. `null` preserves strategy defaults: EAGLE/P-EAGLE 4, DFlash-family 8; use 0 for synchronous loading. |
| `data.cache_dir` | `./cache` | Prepared dataset and derived vocabulary-mapping cache. |
| `data.cache_key` | `null` | Optional explicit namespace when multiple preparations share the same source. |
| `data.max_prompts` | `null` | Optional non-negative prompt cap, useful for smoke tests. |

Offline evaluation uses `eval_hidden_states_path`; configure it together with
`training.eval_interval`. Online evaluation is unsupported, and setting
`eval_data_path` fails config validation.

### `training`: optimization, strategy, and parallelism

Common fields:

| Field | Default | What to write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `training.strategy` | `eagle3` | `eagle3`, `peagle`, `dflash`, `domino`, or `dspark`. |
| `training.backend` | `fsdp` | `fsdp` or optional `torchtitan`. TorchTitan supports CUDA BF16 text DFlash, DFlash2, and DSpark with DP only; see the [backend guide](../../docs/sections/basic_usage/training.md#torchtitan-backend). |
| `training.num_epochs` | `1` | Positive passes over a finite source. |
| `training.max_steps` | `null` | Positive hard stop in optimizer steps. If it is set while `total_steps` is omitted, it is also the fallback schedule horizon. |
| `training.total_steps` | `null` | Positive optimizer/loss schedule horizon; it does not itself stop an online stream. A finite online disaggregated run may omit both fields: the producer publishes the exact horizon derived from prepared prompts, epochs, DP size, batch size, and accumulation. |
| `training.batch_size` | `1` | Per-rank microbatch size. P-EAGLE and USP require 1. |
| `training.accumulation_steps` | `1` | Positive microbatches per optimizer update. |
| `training.fsdp_sharding` | `SHARD_GRAD_OP` | Trainer FSDP mode: `SHARD_GRAD_OP`, `FULL_SHARD`, or `NO_SHARD`. |
| `training.learning_rate` | `1e-4` | Positive peak learning rate. |
| `training.lr_scheduler` | `cosine` | Learning-rate schedule after warmup: `cosine` or `constant`. |
| `training.warmup_ratio` | `0.015` | Fraction in `[0, 1]` used for scheduler warmup. |
| `training.max_grad_norm` | `0.5` | Positive gradient-clipping norm. |
| `training.optimizer_cpu_offload` | `false` | Keep the optimizer's FP32 master parameters and Adam state on CPU. |
| `training.attention_backend` | `flex_attention` | `eager`, `sdpa`, `flex_attention`, `fa`, or `usp`; the selected strategy must support it. |
| `training.tp_size` | `1` | Online disaggregated consumers must keep it at 1; configure target TP on capture servers. Offline non-USP ranks consume disjoint data. |
| `training.sp_ulysses_size` | `1` | Ulysses sequence-parallel factor for offline EAGLE3 USP. |
| `training.sp_ring_size` | `1` | Ring sequence-parallel factor for offline EAGLE3 USP. |
| `training.dist_timeout` | `10` | Positive distributed-operation timeout in minutes. |
| `training.save_interval` | `0` | Save every N optimizer steps; 0 disables periodic saves. A final checkpoint is still written. |
| `training.eval_interval` | `0` | Evaluate every N optimizer steps; 0 disables evaluation. |
| `training.log_interval` | `50` | Positive optimizer-step logging interval. |
| `training.max_checkpoints` | `0` | Keep the newest N checkpoints; 0 keeps all. |
| `training.resume_from` | `null` | Full-run checkpoint/run root: draft, optimizer/scheduler, counters, data position, and RNG. Mutually exclusive with `model.draft_checkpoint_path`. |
| `training.compact_teacher` | `false` | Exact lower-peak-memory teacher projection for offline text EAGLE3. |
| `training.compact_teacher_chunk_size` | `null` | Positive vocabulary chunk size; requires `compact_teacher: true`. |
| `training.trim_loss_positions` | `false` | EAGLE3 only. Compute the teacher target_p, draft logits, and loss only at supervised positions (batch size 1, plain KL loss); mathematically equivalent to the full-length path. |
| `training.dflash_teacher_metrics` | `true` | DFlash/DFlash 2 only. `false` stops online capture of the target's final hidden state, which only feeds the `dflash/teacher/*` diagnostics; the loss is unchanged. |
| `training.role` | `all` | Use `all` for offline colocated training; disaggregated entrypoints select `auto`, `producer`, or `consumer`. |
| `training.seed` | `42` | Run and per-rank RNG seed. |
| `training.prompt_seed` | `null` | Optional online prompt-shuffle seed. `null` preserves the historical behavior of using `training.seed`. |

Strategy-specific fields should be written only when tuning that objective:

| Strategy | Fields and defaults |
| --- | --- |
| EAGLE3 | `training.ttt_length` (`7`), `training.lk_loss_type` (`null`; `lambda`, `alpha`, or `tv`), `training.kl_scale` (`1.0`), `training.kl_decay` (`1.0`) |
| DFlash / DFlash 2 / Domino / D-PACE | `training.num_anchors` (`512`), `training.loss_decay_gamma` (`null`), `training.objective_chunk_blocks` (`128`; `0` materializes all objective logits), `training.loss_type` (`dflash`; fixed decay, or `dpace`; dynamic weighting), DFlash/DFlash 2's `training.lk_loss_type` (`null`; CE, `lambda`, `alpha`, or `tv`), `training.kl_scale` (`1.0`), `training.kl_decay` (`1.0`), DFlash 2's CE selector objective controls `training.dflash2_selector_loss_alpha` (`1.0`), `training.dflash2_selector_warmup_ratio` (`0.0`), `training.dflash2_selector_ramp_ratio` (`0.0`), and `training.dflash2_selector_stop_gradient` (`false`), `training.dpace_alpha` (`0.5`), `training.lambda_base_start` (`1.0`), `training.lambda_base_decay_ratio` (`0.5`) |
| DSpark | Token-pooled objective with valid-first-target anchors and distributed ratio telemetry. Configure the shared `training.num_anchors` (`512`), `training.loss_decay_gamma` (`null`; production recipes use `4.0`), and `training.objective_chunk_blocks` (`128`; `0` materializes all objective logits), plus `training.dspark_ce_loss_alpha` (`0.1`), `training.dspark_l1_loss_alpha` (`0.9`), and `training.dspark_confidence_head_alpha` (`1.0`). |
| P-EAGLE | `training.num_depths` (`8`), `training.down_sample_ratio` (`0.8`), `training.down_sample_ratio_min` (`0.2`), `training.norm_before_residual` (`null`) |
| MTP | `training.mtp_objective_chunk_size` (`4096` token positions per `lm_head` + cross-entropy chunk; `0` disables chunking). |

New recipes must not write the loader-only migration fields
`training.deployment_mode`, `training.server_urls`, or
`training.metadata_db_path`; use the typed `deployment.*` surface below.

### `deployment`: process and service topology

| Field | Default | What to write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deployment.mode` | `local_colocated` | Set `local_colocated` or `disaggregated` explicitly in every new recipe. |
| `deployment.trainer` | default object | Trainer process topology described by the fields below. |
| `deployment.disaggregated` | `null` | Required object only when `deployment.mode: disaggregated`. |
| `deployment.trainer.nnodes` | `1` | Number of trainer nodes. |
| `deployment.trainer.nproc_per_node` | `1` | Trainer processes per node; the single CLI self-launches local ranks. |
| `deployment.trainer.node_rank` | `null` | Node-local rank. Shared multi-node YAML normally omits it and passes `--node-rank`. |
| `deployment.trainer.master_addr` | `null` | Rendezvous address; required when `nnodes > 1`. |
| `deployment.trainer.master_port` | `29500` | Rendezvous port. |

The trainer world size is `nnodes * nproc_per_node`. `training.tp_size` must
remain 1, and the world size must be divisible by
`training.sp_ulysses_size * training.sp_ring_size`.

For `deployment.mode: disaggregated`, also write:

| Field | Default | What to write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deployment.disaggregated.control_dir` | required | Fresh attempt-scoped directory for refs/manifest and lifecycle markers. Shared by default; with `inbox_server_url`, only producer and consumer rank 0 must share it. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.backend` | required | `mooncake` or `shared_dir`. Online disaggregated runs require Mooncake. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.consumer_state_dir` | `null` | Node-local rank-0 SQLite/WAL root. Required for multi-node online consumers; their rank inboxes remain under shared `control_dir`. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.inbox_server_url` | `null` | Optional private `http://host:port` rank-0 relay for tensor-free inbox refs when remote trainer ranks cannot share `control_dir`. Online multi-node only; no credentials, path, query, TLS, or built-in authentication. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.store_root` | `null` | Shared feature directory; required when `backend: shared_dir`. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.store_id` | `null` | Feature-store namespace; defaults to `run_id`. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.server_urls` | `[]` | External patched SGLang capture endpoints. One rollout worker is created per entry. Do not set with `managed_local`. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.mooncake_metadata_server` | `null` | External Mooncake metadata URL. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.mooncake_master_server_addr` | `null` | External Mooncake RPC `host:port`. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.mooncake_local_hostname` | `null` | Node-local Mooncake transfer hostname; usually supplied through the environment. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.mooncake_protocol` | `null` | External transfer protocol such as `tcp` or `rdma`. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.mooncake_rdma_devices` | `null` | External Mooncake RDMA-device selection. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.producer_segment_size` | `null` | Positive allocation owned by an offline Mooncake producer. Online capture is server-owned and forces client segments to zero. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.client_buffer_size` | `268435456` | Per-role Mooncake client buffer in bytes. For `receive_buffers: cuda`, size for the largest concurrently fetched tensors; an 8k-token Qwen3.8-27B feature can exceed this default. Use e.g. `2147483648` and increase with fetch concurrency. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.receive_buffers` | `pinned` | Consumer receive buffers for feature reads: `pinned` (pooled page-locked host buffers, side-stream device copy), `pageable` (fresh host tensor per feature), or `cuda` (pooled device buffers; Mooncake 0.3.x stages RDMA reads through its client buffer). |
| `deployment.disaggregated.receive_pool_bytes` | `8589934592` | Retained receive-pool budget per rank (`pinned`/`cuda`), excluding output copies and concurrent overflow. Failed-transfer buffers remain quarantined for the store lifetime. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.idle_timeout_s` | `null` | Positive consumer idle timeout. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.peer_wait_timeout_s` | `null` | Optional positive producer/consumer peer-completion timeout. Unset is unbounded; expiration fails the attempt. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.producer_hold_s` | `null` | Optional positive offline producer retention timeout. Unset is unbounded; expiration fails the attempt. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.async_ack` | `true` | Online consumer: overlap each optimizer boundary's durable ack (ledger commit, feature removes, DP ack collectives on a dedicated Gloo group) with the next step on a background thread. The durable marker lags by at most one optimizer step and is flushed before every checkpoint, eval, and fit end. Exported as `DISAGG_ASYNC_ACK` (`0` disables; an explicit environment value wins). Multi-node trainers need Gloo TCP reachability between ranks (set `GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME` when the hostname does not resolve to a routable address); disabling it on any rank keeps every rank's acks synchronous on the default process group and creates no Gloo group. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.shutdown_grace_s` | `30.0` | SIGTERM-to-SIGKILL window for a plain supervisor teardown; must cover worker cleanup (Mooncake drains, checkpoint flush, failure sentinels). `managed_local` stacks use `managed_local.shutdown_grace_s`. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local` | `null` | Optional owned single-node Mooncake + capture-server stack described below. |

The four path fields have different ownership:

| Path | Lifetime and visibility |
| --- | --- |
| `output_dir` | Shared durable checkpoints and run outputs. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.control_dir` | Shared, fresh attempt control state. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.consumer_state_dir` | Fresh node-local online-consumer ledger; required for multi-node runs. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.store_root` | Shared offline feature payloads for `shared_dir`. |

An external-service online run writes `server_urls` and Mooncake endpoints in
YAML, or injects their environment equivalents. A managed-local run replaces
those fields with one owned stack:

```yaml
deployment:
  mode: disaggregated
  trainer:
    nnodes: 1
    nproc_per_node: 2
  disaggregated:
    control_dir: ./outputs/domino/control
    backend: mooncake
    managed_local:
      trainer_cuda_visible_devices: ["2", "3"]
      mooncake:
        protocol: tcp
      capture_servers:
        - port: 30000
          cuda_visible_devices: ["0"]
          tp_size: 1
        - port: 30001
          cuda_visible_devices: ["1"]
          tp_size: 1
```

Managed-local fields:

| Field | Default | What to write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.trainer_cuda_visible_devices` | required | One device token per `nproc_per_node`; trainer and capture devices must not overlap. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.mooncake` | default object | Owned loopback Mooncake configuration described by the nested fields below. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.capture_servers` | required | One or more owned patched SGLang server definitions. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.shutdown_grace_s` | `30` | Positive graceful process-group shutdown window. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.mooncake.rpc_port` | `35551` | Owned Mooncake RPC port. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.mooncake.metadata_port` | `35880` | Owned metadata HTTP port. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.mooncake.metrics_port` | `35903` | Owned metrics port. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.mooncake.local_hostname` | `127.0.0.1` | Local transfer hostname. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.mooncake.protocol` | `tcp` | `tcp` or `rdma`. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.mooncake.rdma_devices` | `null` | RDMA-device selection when using RDMA. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.mooncake.global_segment_size_bytes` | `34359738368` | Owned global segment size. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.mooncake.local_buffer_size_bytes` | `1073741824` | Owned local client buffer. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.mooncake.startup_timeout_s` | `60` | Positive Mooncake readiness timeout. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.mooncake.probe_timeout_s` | `5` | Positive, finite budget for one HTTP + TCP readiness probe, capped by the remaining startup timeout. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.mooncake.default_kv_lease_ttl_ms` | `500` | Master key-lease TTL (ms) forwarded to `mooncake_master --default_kv_lease_ttl`. Kept below the consumer's teardown drain window so managed_local shuts down cleanly; set `null` to inherit Mooncake's stock default. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.capture_servers[].port` | required | Unique capture HTTP port. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.capture_servers[].cuda_visible_devices` | required | Device tokens for this server. Their count must equal its `tp_size`. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.capture_servers[].gpu_put` | `null` | Automatically publish from CUDA memory when the capture worker uses RDMA. Set `false` to use host publication or `true` to require GPU publication; `true` requires `mooncake.protocol: rdma`. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.capture_servers[].tp_size` | `1` | Target-model tensor parallelism for this server. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.capture_servers[].mem_fraction_static` | `null` | Optional SGLang static-memory override in `(0, 1]`; otherwise inherit `model.sglang_mem_fraction_static`. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.capture_servers[].attention_backend` | `null` | Server-specific override; otherwise inherit `model.sglang_attention_backend`. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.capture_servers[].startup_timeout_s` | `1800` | Positive server readiness timeout. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.capture_servers[].extra_args` | `[]` | SGLang CLI tokens for this server only, appended after `model.sglang_extra_args` under the same rules. A flag may appear once per command line, so set a per-server flag here and not in the global list. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.capture_servers[].env` | `{}` | Extra environment for this server process, for example the capture patch's `SGLANG_SPEC_CAPTURE_TIMING` or `SGLANG_SPEC_CAPTURE_MAX_PENDING_BATCHES`. Keys the launcher sets are rejected: `MOONCAKE_*`, `DISAGG_*`, device-visibility variables, `SGLANG_SPEC_CAPTURE_GPU_PUT` (use `gpu_put`) and `FLASHINFER_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK`. |
| `deployment.disaggregated.managed_local.capture_servers[].probe_timeout_s` | `5` | Positive, finite HTTP health-probe timeout, capped by the remaining startup timeout. SGLang's generation-based `/health` waits at least one second; allow headroom instead of setting this to one second. |

`startup_timeout_s` bounds the overall readiness wait; `probe_timeout_s` controls
each probe within that window. Increasing only the startup timeout cannot fix
an HTTP probe timeout that is shorter than the server's healthy response time.
The default probe budget supports SGLang's generation-based health check without
disabling health-endpoint generation.

Disaggregated Mooncake trainers use pinned receive pools without additional settings.
With loader prefetch enabled, hidden-state H2D runs in the loader before the batch
reaches training; integer features stay on the host (pinned by loader workers) for
the strategy's non-blocking copy.
Select `receive_buffers: pageable` to restore fresh host receives. The 8 GiB receive-pool
budget is allocated lazily per rank and excludes returned tensors and overflow buffers.

Patched CUDA capture servers use GPU publication automatically when
`MOONCAKE_PROTOCOL=rdma`; TCP and non-CUDA workers use host publication. External
servers can set `SGLANG_SPEC_CAPTURE_GPU_PUT=0` to disable it or `1` to explicitly
enable it. Managed-local `gpu_put: false` also disables an inherited enable flag.

GPU publication retains a device snapshot until the asynchronous store write completes.
Use RDMA-registerable CUDA allocations; with PyTorch, set
`PYTORCH_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False` for capture servers if VMM allocations
cannot be registered by the installed Mooncake/driver combination. Registration
failures are reported before publishing refs.

Managed-local is only for a fresh, single-node, online Mooncake run. It derives
server URLs and Mooncake endpoints, so do not combine it with explicit external
endpoints, `store_root`, or `producer_segment_size`. It does not support resume,
an existing torchrun, or `--node-rank`. All owned ports and GPU assignments must
be disjoint.

### `runtime`: streaming backpressure

This section affects disaggregated streaming producers and is normally omitted
unless tuning throughput or memory pressure.

| Field | Default | What to write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runtime.producer_lease` | `8` | Prompts leased to a rollout worker at once. |
| `runtime.producer_concurrency` | `1` | Concurrent capture calls maintained by each server's logical producer. Increase to keep ingress full without duplicating producers. |
| `runtime.in_flight_high_watermark` | `256` | Pause production at this many committed, unacknowledged refs. |
| `runtime.in_flight_low_watermark` | `192` | Resume production at or below this count; it cannot exceed the high watermark. |
| `runtime.resident_high_watermark_bytes` | `null` | Optional byte-level pause threshold. |
| `runtime.resident_low_watermark_bytes` | `null` | Optional byte-level resume threshold; requires and cannot exceed the resident high watermark. |
| `runtime.feature_store_max_resident_bytes` | `null` | Optional hard store budget; it cannot be smaller than the resident high watermark. |
| `runtime.feature_store_max_quarantined_bytes` | `8589934592` | Per-process Mooncake receive-buffer quarantine limit; exceeding it fails loudly. |

### `tracking`: experiment logging

| Field | Default | What to write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tracking.report_to` | `none` | `none`, `wandb`, `tensorboard`, `swanlab`, or `mlflow`. |
| `tracking.wandb_project` | `null` | W&B project. |
| `tracking.wandb_name` | `null` | W&B run name. |
| `tracking.wandb_key` | `null` | W&B API key; prefer the environment instead of committing it. |
| `tracking.wandb_offline` | `false` | Use W&B offline mode. |
| `tracking.wandb_dir` | `null` | W&B local state directory. |
| `tracking.swanlab_project` | `null` | SwanLab project. |
| `tracking.swanlab_name` | `null` | SwanLab run name. |
| `tracking.swanlab_key` | `null` | SwanLab API key; prefer the environment. |
| `tracking.mlflow_tracking_uri` | `null` | MLflow tracking endpoint. |
| `tracking.mlflow_experiment_name` | `null` | MLflow experiment. |
| `tracking.mlflow_run_name` | `null` | MLflow run name. |

### `profiling`: bounded per-rank traces

| Field | Default | What to write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `profiling.enabled` | `false` | Enable PyTorch profiler traces on trainer ranks. Capture-only producer roles cannot enable it. |
| `profiling.start_step` | `30` | First completed optimizer step to profile. |
| `profiling.num_steps` | `4` | Positive number of optimizer steps to record. |
| `profiling.record_shapes` | `false` | Include tensor-shape metadata at additional overhead. |

### Cross-section checks

- Offline feature consumers require `training.tp_size: 1`. Non-USP ranks each
  consume a disjoint data shard; USP peers share a sequence within their SP
  group while draft-DP groups remain disjoint.
- Online disaggregated runs require `model.target_backend: sglang` and
  `backend: mooncake`. When both step fields are omitted, the producer publishes
  the finite prompt plan's optimizer horizon and the consumer trains to EOF;
  `max_steps` remains an optional hard cap. Every trainer rank is data parallel,
  so
  `training.tp_size`, `training.sp_ulysses_size`, and
  `training.sp_ring_size` must remain 1; configure target TP on each capture
  server.
- USP is offline EAGLE3 only, requires `training.batch_size: 1`, and requires
  `sp_ulysses_size * sp_ring_size > 1`. Non-USP runs keep both SP sizes at 1.
- P-EAGLE reuses the EAGLE3 server feature schema, uses `flex_attention`, and
  requires batch size 1.
- VLM training, including Qwen2.5-VL, is not supported. Online capture accepts
  text inputs only.
- `training.compact_teacher` is offline text EAGLE3 only.
- Online evaluation is not supported. Offline `data.eval_hidden_states_path`
  and `training.eval_interval` must be configured together.

After copying a checked-in recipe to `./my-run.yaml` and editing it, validate
the complete schema and inspect the resolved processes without starting a run:

```bash
specforge train -c ./my-run.yaml --plan
```

Use validated dotted overrides for temporary changes:

```bash
specforge train -c ./my-run.yaml \
  training.learning_rate=5e-5 \
  'deployment.disaggregated.server_urls=["http://capture-0:30000"]'
```

For deeper lifecycle and recovery semantics, see the
[training guide](../../docs/sections/basic_usage/training.md) and
[disaggregated training guide](../../docs/sections/basic_usage/disaggregated_training.md).

## Capability matrix

| Strategy | Online disaggregated | Offline colocated | Offline disaggregated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EAGLE3 | consumer DP | DP + USP | consumer DP |
| DFlash | consumer DP | DP | consumer DP |
| Domino | consumer DP | DP | consumer DP |
| DSpark | consumer DP | DP | consumer DP |
| P-EAGLE | consumer DP, batch size 1 | No | No |

`qwen3-8b-dpace-online.yaml` is the D-PACE recipe. It deliberately uses the
shared DFlash strategy with `training.loss_type: dpace`; D-PACE is an objective
selection inside the unified trainer, not another training entry.

DFlash 2 treats the token objective and position weighting as independent A/B
axes. `training.lk_loss_type: null` keeps hard-target CE, `tv` minimizes the
one-hot total-variation objective, and `lambda` adaptively mixes CE with TV;
`alpha` is equivalent to CE for these hard targets. Independently,
`training.loss_type: dflash` uses `loss_decay_gamma`, while `dpace` applies one
detached dynamic position weight to both the unary and candidate-selector
objectives. For example, LK-lambda with D-PACE uses:

```yaml
training:
  lk_loss_type: lambda
  kl_scale: 1.0
  kl_decay: 1.0
  loss_type: dpace
  dpace_alpha: 0.5
```

Evaluation is currently offline-only and pairs `training.eval_interval` with
`data.eval_hidden_states_path`. Best checkpoints are
linked as `<run_id>-best`. Offline text EAGLE3 may enable
`training.compact_teacher`; `tracking.report_to` selects `none`, W&B,
TensorBoard, SwanLab, or MLflow.

## Ascend NPU launch

Install vendor-matched PyTorch, `torch_npu`, Mooncake, and an NPU-compatible
SGLang capture server first. The `*-npu.yaml` consumers use SDPA while target
capture remains outside the trainer. For example:

```bash
export ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3
export HCCL_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=7200
export HCCL_EXEC_TIMEOUT=7200
export PYTORCH_NPU_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True

specforge train -c examples/configs/online/disaggregated/external/qwen3.5-4b-dflash-online-npu.yaml
```

The unified launcher provides rank/world/rendezvous variables and the runtime
selects HCCL when `torch_npu` is active. For AMD GPUs, install
`requirements-rocm.txt`; HF + SDPA is the portable ROCm starting point.

Offline colocated and offline disaggregated resume are supported.
Disaggregated online recovery resumes only the consumer against retained
control/data-plane state; capture producers always start a fresh attempt.

Migration notes:

- The former `run_qwen3_8b_dflash_disagg_1srv_dp7.sh` self-contained topology
  is retained as `qwen3-8b-dflash-1server-dp7-disaggregated.yaml`: one managed
  capture server on GPU 0 and seven DFlash trainer ranks on GPUs 1–7.
- The former `run_qwen3_8b_domino_disagg_1srv_dp7.sh` self-contained topology
  is retained as `qwen3-8b-domino-1server-dp7-disaggregated.yaml`: one managed
  capture server on GPU 0 and seven trainer ranks on GPUs 1–7.
- The former `run_qwen3.6_27b_dflash_disagg.sh` one-server topology is retained
  as `qwen3.6-27b-dflash-1server-dp2-disaggregated.yaml`: one managed capture
  server on GPU 0 and two trainer ranks on GPUs 1–2. The external-service YAML
  remains available for scheduler-managed deployments.
- The latest pre-cleanup `run_qwen3_8b_domino_disagg_multiserver.sh` had been
  reduced to one SGLang server and one URL despite its historical name. The
  managed Qwen3-8B Domino recipe above restores a genuine two-server topology
  without restoring the legacy trainer script; the external-service Domino
  recipe also accepts any number of typed `deployment.disaggregated.server_urls`.
- The former GPT-OSS-120B shell accidentally selected the 20B draft config;
  `gpt-oss-120b-eagle3-online.yaml` points to the matching 120B config.
- The former Qwen3-235B shell accidentally launched Qwen3-Next-80B; the two now
  have separate recipes.
- Qwen3-Next online EAGLE3 retains its batch size of two. P-EAGLE requires
  batch size one.
- The old Qwen3.5-35B offline shell had its training command commented out. The
  YAML records that intended offline trainer configuration after feature
  preparation.
- Qwen3-8B DTA still shares the DFlash trainer, as before. Its specialized
  behavior is encoded by the draft JSON (`training_mode: vp_drafter`); there is
  no second DTA training entry.
