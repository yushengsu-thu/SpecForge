# Training Plane Design (`specforge.training`)

This is the design note for the **training**, scoped to this plane.
The cross-plane picture (whole-system map, endpoint reference, autonomy) lives in
[`../runtime/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../runtime/ARCHITECTURE.md); the shared records
every plane exchanges are in
[`../runtime/contracts.py`](../runtime/contracts.py).

## Responsibility

Owns the one caller-facing `Trainer` lifecycle that turns a normalized,
tensor-carrying `TrainBatch` stream into optimizer steps and checkpoints.
`Trainer.fit()` is the only package-level training call: it enters any
topology-owned stream context, invokes the internal `TrainerController` over its
private loader, exits the context, and writes the final checkpoint when the
last optimizer step was not already saved by the periodic checkpoint path.
For the disaggregated online consumer, that same lifecycle then publishes its
terminal done/failed signal and always stops the rank-0 ref distributor. Direct
Python builder callers therefore receive the same cleanup guarantees as the
CLI; there is no second wrapper-owned training lifecycle.

Below that boundary, `TrainerController` owns the epoch loop, optimizer-step
counting, interval checkpoints, and durable acknowledgements;
`TrainerCore` owns one branch-free train step and the accumulation boundary;
`DraftTrainStrategy` owns model-specific validation, forward/loss, target
projection, and checkpoint filtering. `DistributedTrainingBackend` shares the
optimizer lifecycle, replicated DDP path, local gradient scaling, and RNG
state. `FSDPTrainingBackend` and `FSDP2TrainingBackend` own their sharding and
model-state APIs; FSDP2 also implements accumulation with
`set_requires_gradient_sync`. `training.backend` selects the implementation,
defaulting to the original `fsdp` backend. `BackendOptions` carries opt-in
behaviors; `training.static_shapes` pads every micro-batch to `data.max_length` and every DFlash-family anchor set to `num_anchors`, so compiled graphs see one input shape (torch 2.13's Inductor cannot lower `flex_attention` with a symbolic context length); `training.compile_blocks` warns without it and compiles each draft block in place before FSDP2 sharding so the composable hooks stay outside Dynamo.
Checkpoint rotation and the latest pointer live in
`specforge.training.checkpoint`. Resume restores each rank's optimizer/RNG
state and repositions fixed offline refs through `FeatureDataLoader.seek()`.
Rank-local checkpoint metadata prevents loading optimizer shards with a
different backend, sharding strategy, or world size. FSDP2's BF16 optimizer
accesses local DTensor storage at use time, retaining ordinary FP32 master
tensors (including CPU offload) and exactly one explicit global-norm reduction.

The training plane is the only tensor-carrying side besides the data plane; it
consumes `TrainBatch.tensors`. `TrainerCore.train_step` divides the loss by
`accumulation_steps`, uses `no_sync()` only for non-boundary micro-batches, and
returns `optimizer_stepped` as the single authoritative boundary signal.
`TrainerController` increments `global_step` only at that boundary, commits the
pending sample acknowledgements, emits metrics, and performs configured
interval saves. The outer `Trainer` owns topology cleanup and the guarded final
save, so CLI, builders, and Python callers cannot select a second loader-based
training entry. All saves delegate to `CheckpointManager`; the shared draft
state is written by rank 0 while every rank writes its own optimizer/RNG state.

Natural end-of-stream is accepted only at an optimizer boundary. If the final
backward is inside FSDP `no_sync`, `fit` fails instead of stepping unreduced
gradients or reporting a checkpoint as successful. Queue-mode loaders
terminally settle and clean a short `drop_last` batch without emitting it;
fixed offline refs keep normal `drop_last` semantics.
