# Customize a training run

Customization starts from a typed YAML config. Pick the closest checked-in
file under
[`examples/configs`](https://github.com/sgl-project/SpecForge/tree/main/examples/configs),
change model and data paths, and keep the same training entry point:

```bash
specforge train --config ./my-run.yaml
```

For one-off changes, use dotted overrides rather than adding another launcher:

```bash
specforge train \
  --config examples/configs/online/disaggregated/external/qwen3-8b-eagle3-disaggregated.yaml \
  model.target_model_path=/models/my-target \
  data.train_data_path=/datasets/my-training-data.jsonl \
  training.learning_rate=5e-5
```

The config is strict: unknown fields, invalid strategy/topology combinations,
and unsupported attention backends are errors. See
[`specforge/config/schema.py`](https://github.com/sgl-project/SpecForge/blob/main/specforge/config/schema.py) and the
[training guide](../basic_usage/training.md) for the accepted fields.

## Chat templates

Register a text chat template in `TEMPLATE_REGISTRY` in
`specforge/data/template.py`, then reference its name with
`data.chat_template`:

```python
TEMPLATE_REGISTRY.register(
    name="your-template-name",
    template=ChatTemplate(
        assistant_header="...",
        user_header="...",
        system_prompt="...",
        end_of_turn_token="...",
    ),
)
```

```yaml
data:
  train_data_path: /datasets/my-training-data.jsonl
  chat_template: your-template-name
  max_length: 4096
```

The server capture runtime accepts text input only. VLM training, including
`qwen2_5_vl`, is not supported. Attention backends are a closed,
strategy-specific set:

| Strategy | Accepted `training.attention_backend` values |
| --- | --- |
| EAGLE3 | `sdpa`, `flex_attention`, `fa`, offline `usp` |
| P-EAGLE | `flex_attention` |
| DFlash, DFlash2, Domino, DSpark | `eager`, `sdpa`, `flex_attention` |

## Target models

For a Hugging Face-compatible target, normally only these model fields need to
change:

```yaml
model:
  target_model_path: organization/model-name
  target_backend: sglang
  trust_remote_code: false
  embedding_key: model.embed_tokens.weight
  lm_head_key: lm_head.weight
```

Every online run uses `model.target_backend: sglang`. Add target-model support
to the SGLang capture server instead of adding an HF/custom target loader to
the trainer. Target TP/EP and model-specific inference stay on that server;
the SpecForge consumer receives only the algorithm's versioned feature schema.
Offline feature training performs no target inference.

EAGLE3 offline sequence parallelism is selected with
`training.attention_backend: usp` plus `training.sp_ulysses_size` and
`training.sp_ring_size`. Evaluation, compact-teacher projection, and experiment
tracking are also config features rather than custom launchers; see the
[training guide](../basic_usage/training.md) for their validated combinations.

## DFlash-family attention modes

DFlash-family draft models select their attention parameterization with
`dflash_config.attention_mode`: `gqa` (the default), `mha`, or `mla`. The mode
swaps only the attention projections inside the shared decoder layer; the
`DFlashDraftModel`, `DFlash2DraftModel`, `DominoDraftModel`, and
`DSparkDraftModel` architectures, target-context injection, per-layer
full/sliding masks, objectives, capture contract, and
`eager`/`sdpa`/`flex_attention` backend selection are identical across modes.
Multi-head Latent Attention is therefore a draft JSON change, not a new
architecture:

```json
{
  "architectures": ["DSparkDraftModel"],
  "hidden_size": 4096,
  "num_attention_heads": 32,
  "q_lora_rank": 1536,
  "kv_lora_rank": 512,
  "qk_nope_head_dim": 128,
  "qk_rope_head_dim": 64,
  "v_head_dim": 128,
  "dflash_config": {
    "projector_type": "dspark",
    "attention_mode": "mla"
  }
}
```

MLA dimensions and behavior use the standard top-level Hugging Face fields:
`q_lora_rank` (`null` selects a direct query projection), `kv_lora_rank`, the
head dims (`qk_nope_head_dim` may be zero; `qk_rope_head_dim` must be even),
and `rope_interleave` for the rotation convention (omitted means interleaved,
the DeepSeek default; `false` selects NeoX-style half rotation). Omitting
`attention_mode` preserves the existing GQA path; `"mha"` requires equal
query/KV head counts.

MLA is a training-side mode: checkpoints train, evaluate through
`spec_generate`, and export through `--to hf`. SGLang serving of DFlash-family
drafts currently implements the GQA/MHA layout only, so plan benchmarks
accordingly. DFlash2 otherwise follows the same mode selection; its convolution
and selector do not change the attention projection contract.

## MoE FFN for DFlash-family drafts

Any DFlash-family draft (DFlash, DFlash2, DSpark) swaps its dense MLP for a
sparse MoE FFN when the draft JSON sets a positive routed-expert count
(`n_routed_experts`, or Qwen's spelling `num_experts`). The MoE is one
configurable layer (`specforge/modeling/draft/moe/`, see its `DESIGN.md`):
a `moe_preset` names a target family's routing recipe, and the architecture
keys use the target checkpoints' native HF names so they can be copied from
the target's `config.json`:

```json
{
  "moe_preset": "deepseek_v4",
  "n_routed_experts": 64,
  "num_experts_per_tok": 6,
  "moe_intermediate_size": 2048,
  "n_shared_experts": 1,
  "dflash_config": {"moe_bias_update_rate": 0.001, "moe_dispatch": "grouped_mm"}
}
```

Top-level keys override the preset (for ablations: `scoring_func`,
`norm_topk_prob`, `routed_scaling_factor`, `balance`, `shared_expert_gate`,
`swiglu_limit`, ...). Training-only knobs live under `dflash_config` with an
`moe_` prefix and never change the checkpoint. Checkpoints, warm starts and
exports keep the official per-expert naming (`experts.{i}.w{1,2,3}.weight`),
so an exported drafter loads into SGLang unchanged. Dense drafts are
unaffected: with no `n_routed_experts` the kernel provider's MLP is used as-is.

`deepseek_v4` is the checked-in preset (DeepSeek-V4 routing:
`sqrtsoftplus` scores, aux-loss-free `noaux_tc` balancing, combine weights
renormalized and scaled by 1.5, one ungated shared expert, SwiGLU clamp 10);
`configs/deepseek-v4-flash-dspark-moe.json` uses it.

`qwen3` is the Qwen3-MoE preset (`softmax` scores over all experts, top-k
combine weights renormalized, no scaling, no shared expert, plain SwiGLU).
`configs/qwen3.8-27b-dflash2-moe.json` uses it for the MoE arm of the
Qwen3.8-27B DFlash2 ablation, with the Qwen key names
(`num_experts: 16`, `num_experts_per_tok: 4`, `moe_intermediate_size: 4352`,
so the activated width equals the dense 17408). Balancing is the same
aux-loss-free `noaux_tc` selection bias as `deepseek_v4`;
`dflash_config.moe_aux_loss_coeff` adds the complementary balance loss when a
from-scratch run collapses onto a few experts.

A new target family is a preset registration plus whichever components it
needs (score function, balance controller, experts backend, shared expert);
each registers by name from its own module.

## Draft architectures

Draft classes register through `@register_draft`. The key defaults to the
class name and must match the single entry in the draft JSON's
`architectures` list:

```python
from transformers import PretrainedConfig

from specforge.modeling.draft.base import Eagle3DraftModel
from specforge.modeling.draft.registry import register_draft


class MyDraftConfig(PretrainedConfig):
    model_type = "my-draft"


@register_draft
class MyEagle3Draft(Eagle3DraftModel):
    config_class = MyDraftConfig

    def __init__(self, config, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(config)
        ...
```

Import the module from `specforge/modeling/draft/__init__.py` so registration
runs before config resolution. A minimal draft config then contains:

```json
{
  "architectures": ["MyEagle3Draft"],
  "model_type": "my-draft",
  "vocab_size": 128256,
  "draft_vocab_size": 32000
}
```

Point `model.draft_model_config` at that JSON. `AutoDraftModelConfig` and the
model assembler resolve both the config and model class from the registry; do
not add a method-specific training launcher.

An architecture alone does not define a new loss. A genuinely new training
algorithm also needs a pure `AlgorithmSpec`, executable `AlgorithmProviders`,
and one immutable `AlgorithmRegistration` under `specforge/algorithms`. Its
step provider may construct a `DraftTrainStrategy`, while its model and data
providers own algorithm-specific assembly. Add builtin registrations to the
explicit catalog used by the application composition root; do not add a
method-specific launcher or a second mutable registry.
